	Implemented flow control for the connections write_buffer. The
	buffer is now of limited size. When it starts to get large, channel
	i/o is disabled. If it hits the limit, the connection is closed.

	* src/connection.c (WRITE_BUFFER_MAX, WRITE_BUFFER_MARGIN): New
	constants.
	(connection_flow_controlled): New class.
	(do_connection_flow_controlled): Reenable channel i/o when we have
	room in the write buffer.
	(make_ssh_connection): Initialize ssh_connection attributes
	wakeup, soft_limit and hard_limit.
	(connection_init_io): Changed argument type from struct
	abstract_write to struct lsh_fd. Install flow control on the
	socket's write_buffer. Deleted the randomness argument, and don't
	call make_packet_write. This way, both handshake_command and
	gateway_make_connection can call this function.

	callback on the connection.

	soft and hard limits.

	replaces old attribute raw. New attributes hard_limit and
	soft_limit. 

	* src/read_data.c (do_read_data_query): Stop reading, if
	connection->hard_limit is set, indicating an almost full
	write_buffer for the connection.

	* src/handshake.c (handshake_command): Adapt to changed
	connection_init_io. Use connection->socket instead of
	connection->raw. 

	* src/gateway_commands.c (gateway_make_connection): Use
	connection_init_io, so that flow control is set up properly.

	* src/channel.c (window_adjust_handler): Deleted redundant assert.
	(do_channels_after_keyexchange): Renamed to do_channels_wakeup. No
	longer needs to reinstall the handler.

	nettle/testsuite. 

	* src/testsuite/testutils.c: Utility functions used by test
	programs.

	until the callout should be invoked.

	* src/handshake.c (handshake_command): Make the connection timeout
	if handshake is not completed within 10 minutes.

2002-02-21  Niels Möller  <nisse@cuckoo.hack.org>

	* src/server_session.c (make_pty): Simple bugfix, pty->master was

	on Solaris have the side effect of making the pty the controlling
	process of the lshd server (if it's running in daemonic mode).
	(pty_open_slave): Renamed function tty_setctty. Now responsible
	also for opening the slave side of the pty, pushing STREAMS
	modules, and setting the tty state.

	mode.

	using pointers.

	* src/sftp/sftp_c.c: General change of calling conventions. Pass
	struct * and const struct *, instead of passing and returning
	structures "by-value".

	* src/sftp/buffer.c (sftp_packet_size): New function.
	(sftp_read_packet): Call clearerr after checking for error and
	eof.
