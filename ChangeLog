	* xalloc.c (lsh_object_clone): New function.

	* server_keyexchange.c (do_init_dh): Copy the server key (as
	strings can't be shared).

	* crypto.c (do_sha_copy, ): Use the CLONE macro instead of memcpy to
	copy instances.
	(do_hmac_copy): -"-

	* (practically every file): Adapted to new gc and object system.

	* xalloc.c (lsh_object_check_subtype): Allow NULL pointers. They
	are occasionally permissible (for instance, the NULL crypto
	algorithm), and when they aren't the error will be detected early
	anyway. 
	(lsh_object_check): -"-

	* keyexchange.c (do_handle_kexinit): Use an object_list for
 	passing around the selected algorithms. The void ** that was used
 	earlier was unfriendly to the gc.

	* lsh.c (main): Bug fix (pass *address* of crypto_rc4_algorithm).
 	Thanks to Keresztfalvi Gabor Agoston <kg230@hszk.bme.hu>.

	* lshd.c (main): -"-

	* lsh_types.h: Moved definitions of UINT* to
	include/crypto_types.h.

	* io.c: Use Sean Reifschneider's poll-by-select emulation if
	poll() is unavailable.
