	strings can't be shared).

	copy instances.
	(do_hmac_copy): -"-

Fri Dec  4 02:30:28 1998    <nisse@puck>

	* (practically every file): Adapted to new gc and object system.

	* xalloc.c (lsh_object_check_subtype): Allow NULL pointers. They
	are occasionally permissible (for instance, the NULL crypto
	algorithm), and when they aren't the error will be detected early
	anyway. 
	(lsh_object_check): -"-

	* keyexchange.c (do_handle_kexinit): Use an object_list for
 	passing around the selected algorithms. The void ** that was used
 	earlier was unfriendly to the gc.
