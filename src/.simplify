blocking_write.h

  Used only by lsh-keygen.c. Should be deleted.

channel.h

  struct channel_open_info should perhaps be used more, or deleted.

  should the write attribute be removed from ssh_channel?

  channel_request_info. 

  Change the fallbacks (used by the gateway), to pass the entire
  packets.
