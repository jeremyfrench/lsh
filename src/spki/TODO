Some questions: Computing intersections and inclusions between sets
and ranges seems tricky. For instance, do one need to handle

   (* set (* range numeric (ge #00#) (le #20#)))

includes

   (* range numeric (ge #05#) (le #15#))

What if certificate reduction ends up with more than one reduced 5
tuple?

Implement range, and figure out if and how to support all the
different range types.
