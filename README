LSH - a free implementation of the Secure Shell protocols.


LSH IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. DON'T EXPECT THE CURRENT VERSION TO WORK,
AND *DON'T* EXPECT IT TO PROVIDE ANY SECURITY WHATSOEVER.

INSTALLATION

If you have downloaded a snapshot, you should be able to compile it
with

   ./configure
   make

If you want to hack lsh, you need some more tools: autoconf, automake,
GNU-make, gcc, gperf (at least version 2.7) and scsh. All but scsh can
be found at your local GNU mirror site. scsh, Olin Shiver's Scheme
Shell, can be downloaded from <URL:
ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/su/scsh/scsh.tar.gz>.

If you have checked out lsh from CVS, things are more complicated. You
must first generate Makefile.am files from the corresponding
Makefile.am.in files. Do this by running ./make_am in the top level
directory. Next, you need to run autoconf, autoheader and automake.
This creates the configure script and a Makefile.in. Now you can try
./configure ; make. If the compiler complains that it can't find a
file foo.h.x, try creating it with make foo.h.x or ./make_class <foo.h
>foo.h.x, and similarly for missing foo.c.x files.


NEEDED LIBRARIES

GMP-2.0.2 can be found at ftp.gnu.org, or some of its mirrors.

ZLIB can be found at ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/zlib.html or
http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/. Latest version is zlib-1.1.3.


GETTING STARTED

Some examples...

Create a new DSS key pair, and save it in NEW_KEY and NEW_KEY.pub:

  ./lsh_keygen  -l 8 | ./lsh_writekey NEW_KEY

Start an lshd server on port 4711, using the key created above as the
server host key:

  ./lshd -p 4711 -h NEW_KEY

Connect to an lshd server running on port 4711 on HOST, and attempt to
log in as USER:

  ./lsh -p 4711 -l USER HOST
