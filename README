LSH - a free implementation of the Secure Shell protocols.


LSH IS WORK IN PROGRESS. DON'T EXPECT THE CURRENT VERSION TO WORK, AND
*DON'T* EXPECT IT TO PROVIDE ANY SECURITY WHATSOEVER.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation. See the file COPYING for details.

If you have downloaded a snapshot, you should be able to compile it
with

   ./configure
   make

If you want to hack lsh, you need some more tools: autoconf, automake,
GNU-make, gcc, gperf (at least version 2.7) and scsh. All but scsh can
be found at your local GNU mirror site. scsh, Olin Shiver's Scheme
Shell, can be downloaded from <URL:
ftp://ftp-swiss.ai.mit.edu/pub/su/scsh/scsh.tar.gz>.

If you have checked out lsh from CVS, things are more complicated. You
must first generate Makefile.am files from the corresponding
Makefile.am.in files. Do this by running ./make_am in the top level
directory. Next, you need to run autoconf, autoheader and automake.
This creates the configure script and a Makefile.in. Now you can try
./configure ; make. If the compiler complains that it can't find a
file foo.h.x, try creating it with make foo.h.x or ./make_class <foo.h
>foo.h.x, and similarly for missing foo.c.x files.

For an introduction to the workings of LSH, see the file HACKING.

Several people have contributed to LSH, see the AUTHORS file for
details.
